0,Franco Manca,If FM had enough staff then…,"If Franco Manco had enough staff then we wouldn’t have had to wait 30 minutes to get into Franco Manca Covent Garden last night but one waiter per floor is ridiculous. Yes the were busy and we love FM but have never had to wait over 40 minutes for a pizza. Delicious as usual but more staff please. Kudos to the staff there who were working incredibly hard, courteous with a smile. The whole process 1 1/2hrs in the end!","Oct 27, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
1,Franco Manca,What has happened to Franco,"What has happened to Franco? Used to be a pleasure. Staff no longer interested in serving - hands in pockets. Ignoring customers having a chat. No urgency in serving, cooking or general pleasant service. Can’t comment on food quality - I gave up and left!!","Oct 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

3,Franco Manca,Like being in Napoli!,"It was like being in Napoli with the rudeness & arrogance of the staff at the Kilburn Franca Manca.  Started off with one of our party who was deaf and did not hear the waiter being castigated for not acknowledging the staff, poor man stated he never heard the waiter talking to him at all.Waiter then said he did not need to write down the order as he could remember and subsequently order came to table incorrectly. We tried to rectify but staff were busy elsewhere, (one on a smoke break)!Food was not great, soggy watery pizza, not great at all. We had also ordered one pizza for takeaway which was ordered at the beginning of the meal and to to our amazement when we got home we had an empty box instead of a pizza, I think there was a miscommunication and this was laughable! Awful service, awful pizza, awful experience.  Real sense of an unmotivated staff, ( and that is a kind way of putting it)! Avoid at all costs, they will never see a penny of mine again!","Oct 16, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
4,Franco Manca,"Trafford Centre, not good","Trafford Centre:Server didn’t fill me with confidence our order had been correctly taken despite us repeating it several times, almost couldn’t cope with the idea that our 9 year old might want a full size pizza. Sure enough her pizza never turned up, asked where it was and they were genuinely surprised that all 4 of us might be wanting to eat.Wife’s pizza was pretty tasteless, toppings on mine was cold to lukewarm. The kids pizzas were ok. Honestly would have had more culinary enjoyment from a store bought pizza, just extremely disappointing, won’t be returning","Sep 26, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars
5,Franco Manca,No refunds nor apology when overcharged!,"No refunds given when overcharged and told to write to head office for it! Ordered 5 pizzas and 3 salads between 7 of us. Errors were made in delivering our pizzas to our table.After much conversation with the waitress that we really did not order the pizzas she trying to persuade us to accept, we were given the correct order.After a friend paid the bill, we realised that we were also charged for the incorrect pizzas and an 'optional!' service was added too.We spoke with the manageress asking for a refund of the pizzas we didn't order and didn't eat. She said, ""It's your mistake and you should have checked your bill before you paid!""After much insisting, she said that she couldn't refund any money and that we should write to head office. No apology was given. Sooooo disappointing. Terrible manner from their manager Rachele who said their mistake is our mistake.She eventually filled in a refund form and said she'd send it off.Reading reviews, it seems that others have also been told no refunds are given. We do not have any hope for receiving money 'taken' from us.I suggest that mangers are taught to apologise and try and be kind and helpful rather than switching the blame. Was also rather off-putting to have person making pizzas wearing trousers and underpants falling from bottom, exposed two inches of it! Nice food cannot make up for terrible service! Shall never recommend nor return.","Oct 15, 2023",
6,Franco Manca,Very sad to see another poor customer service experience. Why,"We discovered Franco Manca in august, Southampton branch. It was the only restaurant with a table in the area and it wasn’t too bad. We thought the sourdough pizza was a bit chewing good texture and red wine in a tumbler? The menu is only pizza and some odd topping choices but hey Ho we were hungry. So when we recently were in london, the Aldwych branch popped up as a pre theatre option and we figured okay let’s go! We booked a table for 5:30 and arrived bang on time. On arrival the guy who checked us in frankly couldn’t really be bothered. They were clearly busy, but there is no need to make your ‘guests’ feel like they don’t want you to be there. There was no table, He said can you sit over there at the bar. In any other restaurant I have ever been to this means we will hold you here until a table is free but no, the bar here is four seats next to each other to eat. Not an ideal family meal out. Families came in after us and we’re show to a table of four. So what is the point of booking a table? We were given no choice but we English don’t want to kick up a fuss and nor do I want to do so on a family night out with our young Son. The food was poor all the toppings were literally thrown into the middle of the pizza so most of the pizza is just dough and a bit of cheese at best. Wine in a tumbler. Rustic some might say. Okay but just no better than a cheap takeaway in the street. When we came to pay they had added a service charge said optional and make no mistake I always reward good service but the guy who we met and who did most of the servicing was poor communication and just did not gel with his customers so I asked for the service charge to be removed. They then all went into a huddle and giving us the eye making us feel uncomfortable. He asked why and I told him why and he said we are having a very busy night. Sorry but that’s no excuse for not caring and making customers feel like they have had a service. If your not in a rush and just want a cafe pizza indoors but no engagement from the staff and happy without a restaurant experience but pay restaurant prices then okay but we won’t be going again. Looking at overall reviews another soon to be victim of nice try but failed. You’d think a company of this size would listen to its customers and get the staff and n basic customer service courses. With a 2.7 rating something can be done about it as statistically over time this has slowly been dropping.","Updated Oct 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

14,Franco Manca,"Uncooked, cold/lukewarm, burnt food","Our experience with the Lincoln branch was poor in every respect. Food arrived cold/lukewarm, burnt and uncooked in places. The sourdough base for both pizzas was soggy in texture and the focaccia black and burnt. Management made contact and provided assurance that they would look into matter. One week later, despite having my contact details, just one silent 25 second recorded phone message was left.","Jun 4, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
15,Franco Manca,Negligent with regard to food allergies,I ordered gluten free pizza from this store and they accidentally made me a normal pizza containing gluten. I'd eaten some of it before questioning and then they confirmed they'd made a mistake. I was on a strict gluten free diet post gut surgery and ended up in a lot of pain for 24 hours plus it was a very scary experience. The restaurant didn't even offer a refund of the food. They investigated and admitted the mistake but said all their procedures were fine as it was the fault of the ticket system! They really don't seem to understand the importance of getting it right when it comes to allergies or contraindications. Thankfully I had no long-term issues but they could kill someone with this attitude.,"Aug 18, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

I've ate at Putney, Richmond, Wimbledon, Battersea, and both the Westfields branches, and the dining experience has been superb at every one. The only one that didn't quite meet the same standards as the others was Cambridge, but it was during Eat Out to Help Out so I assume this could be down to the current restrictions when eating out, and how busy it was.

30,Franco Manca,Chichester meal for two,"Chichester. First time using this chain. Not impressed. Staff very polite and helpful but tables are tiny, not enough room for plates and glasses, let alone dips or oil bottles etc. The huge pizza crust forms about 5cm of the perimeter of the pizza, so only the middle of the pizza has any topping! For us it was far to soggy underneath (I like sourdough but this was stodgy) and the large crust was heavy to consume. The toppings weren't well or evenly constructed and not much flavour either. Sadly a disappointment all round and likely won't be re visiting. After reading the reviews post our experience, I see some people have quoted 'best pizza' in their review??? Maybe other branches are better? We politely informed our waitress of our constructive criticism and she was very polite and professional in her response.","Jul 1, 2023",

He was frequently checking on us if we were needing anything and updating us about the waiting time for the drinks and pizzas which was very fast. I gave them 4 starts instead of 5 because I brought an ice cream cake and instead of putting it in the freezer they put it in the fridge because they did not have space and it was not in the original condition and almost melted when we had it.,"Nov 14, 2021",

One waiter was attempting to cover what seemed like the whole restaurant. To his credit he remained cheerful and professional but he was swimming against the tide. The jug of water he offered to get for us never materialised. We did eventually manage to get a couple of pizzas which were underwhelming to say the least.

65,Franco Manca,Oh dear ….,We decided to go to Kingston’s Franco Manca and to be fair we didn’t book. The restaurant was busy but not overly. We sat at the table before presumably the manager ( who whispered and we couldn’t hear what she was saying  ) came to serve us and only because I caught her attention. Well over 45 mins later the food had not  arrived but I guess with only two chefs & a restaurant half full along with outside orders we kind of set the expectation. Lots of serving staff looking like they had no idea what they were doing.

67,Franco Manca,Chunky and dry pizza,"I ordered a pizza which was not well cooked at all. The ingredients were thrown on top into chunks which didnt melt even when I popped it in the oven as recommended. The pizza had far too much N'duja, which was not nicely distributed. The pizza had far too much oil and the mozzarella was dry. This is not the first time I've been disappointed by Franco Manca - often I have had to order extra amounts of basic ingredients (such as tomato sauce& mozzarella) to make it taste as  a good pizza should. I don't think I'll be spending another 15 pounds on a pizza which does not meet basic expectations.","Aug 29, 2021",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

After one hour I received a pizza that was mainly burned, and the middle part was missing the dough, it had just the tomato sauce.

Also hated the fact there was no tomato base for it just tomato sauce slammed on top of the really cheap undercooked ingredients. The service was fairly quick although the staff looked exhausted. The atmosphere was nice but the music was way too loud I couldn't talk to my parent well.

Back on May 2021 I decide to take my son out for the day, no-holds bard fun fun fun, we went all-over London or at least what we could fit in.  During the day and as always, you will get peckish and in my sons case bloody hungry, he's stomach on legs.  Any how, as it happened, whilst starting to get that desperate feeling as not knowing where to go for lunch, we were standing outside Franco's.  Right place at the right time.  As we approached the door, we were greeted very courteously & professionally, asked to sanitise hands, scan check-in, then we were seated by the window.  We were handed menu's, ordered drinks, told about the specials etc, nothing new, just great service.  The cheerful guy that served us was extremely good at his job, despite giving some tip that might help him in the future, went by the name 'Luciano'.  Honestly no one could ask for better in how someone could look after their customers.  Having struck conversation with Luciano, just made the whole lunch more worthwhile.  Feeling pretty tired going into the restaurant, its amazing how conversation and a giggle can revitalise guests to crack on and have a great afternoon.  So, YES, my son and I will be going back to Franco Manca's, soon hopefully, food was extremely good, service was exceptional, but Luciano, just made the experience that much better.  Mainly its because having been in lock-down for SO long, just great to talk with another human being.","Aug 20, 2021",

The starters are excessively large - the rosemary and sea salt pizza dough is an amount of dough equivalent to a pizza. Again, everything is just far too salty.

132,Franco Manca,Don't blame staff…blame senior management,"Went to the Wimbledon restaurant this afternoon for my birthday with 4 friends. The service was dire and I will never return.I spoke to the manager, and although I gave her my opinion,  she explained that she is understaffed. I can only sympathise with her and the other staff. This is an issue in the hospitality sector and it is sad that Mr Nabil Mankarious and his team are not willing to see this and provide help where it matters. Mr M.. you can either bury your head in your latest results (pat on the back!) and assume the next quarter is the same...and lose your business...or you can help your staff to understand the issues and help out. There is a lot YOU can do. Get out of your ivory tower.Your assets...your staff and customers,  without either you have no business.It was my 1st time and last time at Franco Manca. I am surprised that your staff continue to work under such dire conditions. There are plenty of hospitality jobs available in Wimbledon.","Aug 17, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

141,Franco Manca,"We have been charged extra, given bad service and never received the refund for incorrectly charged items","Hello, I have visited Franco Manco restaurant in South Kensington with my mum on the 22nd July 2023 around 5pm. We had a pizza with a tiramisu and drinks. I don’t always look at the bill but I’m glad I did as they charged us 2 extra items which counted for 30% of the bill value. When I told the staff member, there was no apology and we were told that we have to fill in a form for a refund as this is the policy and then wait up to 5 days for the money to be refunded. My mum was not happy as this has never happened, money is normally refunded straight to the card, especially when this was not our fault - they put random items (extra ice cream and tiramisu) on our bill. When we filled in the form, I asked if there in any proof they can provide and the member of staff just smiled at me that this is a billion dollar company and they refund every customer. I believe this was a manger as the lady was dressed differently; not in uniform, with dark hair. It was not the person who asked for our order. Until today - 3rd of August, the refund was not received. I am very disappointed with the service and basically being robbed. Thanks a was a visit of my mum in London and we never came across situation like this in a restaurant. I have also emailed Franco Manco via their website and have not received any response. I would like to know how I can received this money back and how is this possible to happen in a big chain like this. This is only £10 pounds but as I mentioned it is 30% of the bill, the service provided was horrible, and we have never been refunded. My mum is not from London so she has no way even going back to the restaurant, it is additional time and money and it has been inconvenient enough to deal with this situation.

151,Franco Manca,Soggy food and all over the place service,"After going to Franco Manca in London a few times I was excited to hear it was coming to Chichester. I was however very disappointed with my experience (which I really hope is just teething problems being newly open). We waited 45 minutes for a table which is understandable with it being new and exciting. But soon after we were seated we had our drinks order taken - these never arrived until our starters were served 25 minutes later. The starters were very pleasant, no issues at all. When our main courses arrived, our pizzas were very soggy - it looked like a glass of water was poured over it. I tried eating a slice but it made me nauseous and could not eat more. When the waitress came over she apologised but told me it’s how it’s supposed to be when made when with buffalo mozzarella - which I’ve never seen this wet before. The base was undercooked and soaked. I’ve had great experiences in Franco Manca before, it’s just a shame that this experience was very poor. I noticed other tables being left unattended and had conversations with other customers who also never received their drinks. We had 3 different waiting staff attend to us so it was clear no one had delegated sections, and no one was focused on drink orders as it was a bit all over the place.I hope they take all feedback on board and can improve their service and dining experience over all as it is generally a good restaurant chain and I’d like to give benefit of the doubt regarding this experience.","Nov 3, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

155,Franco Manca,Franco Manca (South Ken branch) - serving bad vibes with your pizza,"Franco Manca has always been a to-go-to place for pizza cravings around London, and we had exactly that on Sunday 15th Aug after visiting V&A next door.The restaurant was nowhere near full, but we were pointed to a mini table near the kitchen and given a judgemental look when suggesting a 4-seater (many of which were available). We are both 6ft tall and leg space is always appreciated, but of course we would move if larger parties were to come in afterwards. Noone expects a 5* service (just a delicious pizza served with a smile, thank you!), but interactions with the staff were rather unpleasant - it felt like the place was run by teenage girls with no supervision or customer service training. The order arrived quickly, but no-one checked on us throughout dinner and eye contact attempts were proficiently ignored. We ran out of water and could not order anything else as the waitress simply brushed by the table collecting empty glasses/bottle without asking if refill is needed. The bill arrived incorrect and instead of explaining the error proactively, the girl waited for it to be questioned - again, no customer service skills whatsoever (where a simple sincere apology would have done the trick). We paid and left without placing any complaints as this would have been simply pointless and would make the experience even more bitter.All in all - although hospitality is going through a rough time - please train your staff better, service is still about quality not quantity. A smile, as such, costs nothing - even post-pandemic!","Updated Oct 25, 2022",

Usually the fill the bowl up. 2) We then ordered a side of mozzarella and garlic bread (which is the same price as the pizza) and we barely had any mozzarella on the bread. It was also luke warm when it arrived to the table and not hot like their pizzas and food usually is. 3) the two waitresses were just lazy and looked like they didn't even want to be there or do their job. 4) pizzas arrived luke warm and not straight away from the oven like they normally used to do. And it wasn't even the right order after making us wait 15+ minutes for food. Will not be visiting this branch again. Service and quality has gone down the drain massively.

185,Franco Manca,Not recommend for families with young children.,"I popped into the Richmond branch at around 5pm on Thursday 30th September to discuss holding my 3-year old's birthday party in the basement. I took a table until a member of staff was available to show me the event hire area. I went to fetch a high chair for my 11-month-old who was in her pushchair. As I crossed the room my baby started crying. A woman customer sitting with a man at a table nearby asked to be moved and gave me a dirty look which made me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. Seeing the staff were busy and now feeling unable to relax, I decided to leave and return another time. The waitress helped me to the door and then as I was leaving the woman customer with absolutely no provocation whatsoever stuck her middle finger up at me. The waitress also witnessed this vile and rude gesture. I was extremely upset, flabbergasted and at a complete loss to understand what had just happened. I responded to the woman that she had no right to treat me like that especially as I was leaving the premises because she had made me so uncomfortable. At this point, the woman customer leapt from her seat and began to scream at me in an aggressive and frightening manner. At this point I was completely overwhelmed and felt faint. The young waitress helped me to the ground and I was shaking. The woman continued to scream at me. It was clear she had completely lost all self-control. The woman’s behaviour was totally disproportionate to the small amount of noise my children had made. I felt frightened and intimidated at this outburst. To make matters worse my three-year-old started crying because she too was frightened and upset I had collapsed. She couldn’t understand why this woman was screaming at us. This was a very upsetting incident for my children to witness. The female staff member (who I think was called Danielle) was incredibly kind and was obviously shocked herself. She soothed the children and gave us apple juice. She offered for us to stay and was very clear we had every right to be there, which of course we did. However, I did not feel safe with this woman in the same restaurant and didn’t want my children around someone who had such a short temper and whose behaviour was clearly unpredictable.My complaint is that whilst the young staff member was extremely kind and caring, a senior member of staff should have stepped in to deal with this. To allow a customer to use what is probably the most aggressive and offensive gesture towards me -  completely unprovoked - in what I thought was a family-friendly restaurant with no repercussions or consequences is totally unacceptable and outrageous. I no longer feel that Franco Manca is a safe environment for women, girls or young children.I emailed a complaint to the management of Franco Manca and received a woefully inadequate response which did not deal with the intimidation or the offensive gesture used. It was purely perfunctory. So be clear, Franco Manca allows its customers to be verbally abused, bullied and intimidated and the perpetrator is welcome to stay at the restaurant and the victim needs to leave to feel safe. Management conceded in their email that they had no official policy to deal with such incidents which I found staggering.  Of course the venue now will not be used for my daughter's birthday party, nor we will ever visit any branch of Franco Manca again. It's clearly not a safe family environment. Shame on you, Franco Manca.","Oct 2, 2021",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

He needs to be sacked as I am sure this kind of behaviour is not acceptable in hospitality industry.","Aug 3, 2020",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
208,Franco Manca,DO NOT GO HERE AFTER LOCK DOWN,"DO NOT GO HERE AFTER LOCK DOWN Went to the Northcote Road restaurant, not very impressed at all. Firstly sat us on a table with no screens and waiters going past constantly with no distance. which was very uneasy. Table of 6 teenagers next to us - they then had friends arrive in the restaurant - so now over a group of 8 inside hugging and not observing distancing and no one said anything. Everyone on that table touched the card machine and I watched the waiter myself just put it back and use on another table. No gloves masks or sanitiser offered and toilets were DISGUSTING.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE","Jul 11, 2020",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

211,Franco Manca,Great service!,Hello. I genuinely had a great experience with Franco Manca Bishops Gate. The food is delicious for starters but on top of that the service we received following up on a delivery issue with a third party company was spectacular and just want to show my appreciation. Very good food and great service. Thanks Bishops Gate Team.,"Jun 4, 2020",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
212,Franco Manca,"Manager ""it's the dirty and irresponsible customers fault""","Their takeaway boxes are once again littered all over Bermondsey Street. I asked the manager what he could do and he said; nothing!""it's the dirty and irresponsible customers fault""I always thought the Pizzas were poor. Hearing the manager shout this in the restaurant perhaps isa clue to his care with the food.","May 22, 2020",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
213,Franco Manca,Bad service,"I ordered a pizza for takeaway at the Westfield Shepherds Bush branch on my lunch break as i work in the shopping centre, i went to collect it, and when i got back to my store i realised the pizza was uncooked and wasn’t made the correct way, as a regular customer at franco manca, i know what pizza i usually order and what it should look like. When i went back to the restaurant i explained that i was not satisfied and explained why, but i was told that the pizza is always made that way. I then showed pictures of the pizza i normally buy from franco manca, and that was then when the host said they can remake it. She then came back and told me that the oven is off because the restaurant was closing early at 3pm?!. So i requested a refund and had to fill out form with just my name, email and bank details. This took away from my whole hour lunch break, i have never experienced such bad customer service before. I usually visit the stratford branch which is much better, more friendly and i’ve never had to complain about anything. As a manager i feel that a refund should have been issued there and then, im not happy with the service i received at all and would like a refund immediately","Updated Mar 19, 2020",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
214,Franco Manca,Worst experience ever Franco Manca Greenwich!!!!!!,"Franco Manca GreenwichMy wife ordered a pizza for herself and a starter for me, and she asked for it to arrive at the same time, and my pizza was to arrive 10 minutes after.After 30 minutes, it was evident that Antonio had forgotten my pizza.My wife attracted Luciano's attention and asked him where my pizza was.His reply was, ""do you want it or not""?When I asked if it was ready or not, he said that Antonio had forgotten to order it and that he would bring the email address for me to log a complaint.Not even an apology...I asked him to let Antonio bring the email address and to explain what had happened as the restaurant was not very busy.15 minutes later my wife attracted the attention of another waitress and asked for the bill.I noticed that Antonio had his coat on already and seemed to be ready to leave.I went over to his table and asked why he had not come over to explain what had happened.It turns out that Luciano had not spoken to him at all.Antonio was our server, yet he never came to our table to check on us or bring our meal.When I asked Luciano why he did not pass on the message to Antonio, he just shrugged his shoulders.When I asked how stupid one has to be to forget an order in a half empty restaurant, Antonio assaulted me by forcibly ejecting me from the restaurant, adding that it was late and they were tired.I told him that he was in the wrong business if he did not have the stamina or professionalism for the job, he should work elsewhere...and then again, he assaulted me by forcing me out on the street.Why are these unprofessional and dishonest thugs working in a Greenwich restaurant?1 star is too generous on this occasion...and no dinner for me!Rude thugs for staff, poor service, no customer service.Search ""Franco Manca"" at TrustPilot to read all the bad reviews.How is this chain still in business and how does one close them down???","Updated Mar 14, 2020",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
215,Franco Manca,Possibly the worst pizza in the world,"You would think that if pizza is basically the only thing you serve, you would do it very well. Not at Franco Manca. My pizza arrived completely undercooked  and doughy. I sent it back and they made a fresh one. That came back in exactly the same state. Maybe it’s how they’re meant to be and I’m in the wrong expecting a crisp base. The only way to eat the pizza is with a knife and fork or to roll it up. Picking up a slice is not an option as the dough has no structural integrity. Besides the dough being barely edible the toppings, which were very sparse were also dreadful. Half cooked, greasy sauté potatoes anyone? We had 8 pizzas between us. Every single one was undercooked and yet the crusts were brown. Which makes you think that the oven is simply not up to the job. We also had a bottle of house red - this was completely undrinkable and had to go back, not because it was corked, it was just dreadful quality wine.","Feb 23, 2020",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
216,Franco Manca,The worst pizza ever had!!! Poor service...,Pizza n. 7 on the menu had not wild broccoli at ALL and it was tasteless and very spongy! The service was very poor.

217,Franco Manca,My experience with Franco manca,"I was recommended Franco manca by a few friends and even heard about it from my mum. The comments were all positive so I thought I would try the place out. So when I finally decided to go there I ordered a ham and mushroom pizza, when the pizza arrived I was surprised to see a blob on tomato sauce in the middle which was relatively small I’m not sure if I was supposed to be like this but I was highly disappointed as tomato purée is supposed to be the base layer and fill the whole pizza instead it was just a lot of mozzarella. The pizza was also very soft and very doughy. It still tasted nice but I was overall disappointed with the result. Don’t think I would go there again.","Updated Jan 4, 2020",Rated 2 out of 5 stars
218,Franco Manca,Richmond Franco Manca,"We have been going to Richmond Franco Manca for couple of years now, choosing it over Pizza Express which is on the same road. We have been enjoying pizza and coffee each time but the service could be improved. Last time we went there with our three year old, we were offered a small table and asked if we could seat at a bigger table. We sat there hoping that someone would clean and set it up quickly but the order was taken and table still not set up. When the juice arrived I grabbed glasses and cutlery from another table. We always need a high chair for our three year old. We are never offered it and always ask for it. They never give us one unless I ask three times or go and grab it myself. Last week, my little daughter asked the waitress for a highchair herself and was told that the it is coming. Then the waitress went on doing other things and never brought the high chair so we fetched it ourselves and she saw it. Then she did not bring sugar for my coffee. Could not be bother to ask her for anything at this point. Then after pizza which was delicious as always my husband ordered coffee and sugar came along! ......I was annoyed by it all as their service is usually a bit sloppy and not very attentive but last time was quite poor. It looks a bit like the staff are not trained at all about the service they should provide and what should be done when. At least pizzas are tasty.","Updated Jan 4, 2020",Rated 3 out of 5 stars
