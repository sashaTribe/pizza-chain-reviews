1,Prezzo,"Shameful Customer Service - Prezzo @ The Light, Leeds","Well we thought what would be nicer than a fine meal before the gig around the corner in the Frist Direct Arena Leeds.  Family of four sat outside.The starters arrived early and the drinks were quick - though we kept being harassed by a waitress trying to sell us more drinks at regular intervals.One of the main reasons we booked was menu choice due to vegan/veggie options. Long story short despite trying to chase up our food several times it took more than 1hr and 15mins to arrive and it was pretty rubbish and tasteless.  The staff seemed unconcerned though we did get something knocked off the bill as a gesture.Another table, also outside, experienced very similar issues.  Avoid - or sit inside, maybe they notice you better in there.","Oct 17, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

The table server (different) was actually very helpful and served us very well and accommodated our every need.  She could not do enough. However the two young front staff ladies defo need training. They did bring our desserts but they don't know how to be polite or smile. Prezzo here is why you are failing and going down the tubes. Cannot have this in the service industry.

13,Prezzo,Disappointing visit.,"We are regular visitors to Prezzo, but were rather disappointed when we visited the Aldeburgh branch recently. My ragu was fine, and would have merited five stars, but my wife ordered the sea bass, usually a favourite, and it was not up to the usual standard. The rocket salad was dry, with no trace of a dressing, and there was no aubergine as promised on the menu. It seemed that the kitchen had run out, but we were not told this when we ordered. Our waitress (who had not taken the original order) was apologetic, and said we should have been told, but we noticed that at least one other diner was being served the same meal without being told of the missing ingredient.When we went to pay, we did not ask for a reduction, though we did feel it could have been offered. The waiter, Joe?, who had taken our order, did not seem concerned, though one of the waitresses did apologise again. All in all, something of a disappointment.","Aug 1, 2023",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

19,Prezzo,Prezzo. A sad image of its former self.,"Food quality extremely poor and well overpriced. Prior to the decline and reduction of venues Prezzo was first class for quality, staff, service and ambience in our opinion. Prior to Covid we regularly visited Prezzo at Whiteley, Fareham. Excellent in every respect. Since the beginning of 2023 we have visited twice using Tesco vouchers. No criticism of staff. Recent visit midday 10/May. Reaffirmed our opinion of current food quality. Cheapest ingredients used with absolutely minimal amounts of the more costly items . ( chicken, salmon, etc.) presentation poor. Al Forno dish suspected microwave item. Value abysmal.

We had desert and departed.We did notice that several tables whilst we were there had similar issues of either missing or incorrect dishes and this all seemed to be kitchen error and not waitress errors,"Updated Jan 16, 2022",Rated 3 out of 5 stars
67,Prezzo,Poor standard,"I have had many good experiences in this restaurant, but I must say that the menu is quite limited. They took off some of the best dishes (e.g. meatballs for starter) and replaced them with food that hardly anyone would like and there is not much option if you don't fancy anything too extravagant. Also, there have been many times when my food was cold or it was not cooked anywhere near the expected standard for this type of restaurant and these were not one-off experiences. I have had to send my food back almost every other time I visit one of these restaurants and it was not always to same place either.On the whole, this is a good restaurant, but I think they need to step up their game if they wish for customers to continue coming back.","Nov 12, 2022",

The first waitress was accommodating and helpful and the separated the sauce from the food. But then another waiter took over the orders for the desserts. I asked whether they could again separate the sauce from a gluten free cheese cake. The waiter seemed offended that I had asked this. He was rude, snappy and refused to even ask the chef if it was possible and just told me that I either have it as it is or none at all. Please train your staff stop be understanding if someone asks you to alter the dish. Be aware of people’s needs. I think you have a way to go in terms of flexibility before I could recommend this restaurant to the Slimming World community.","Apr 23, 2022",Rated 2 out of 5 stars
125,Prezzo,"Foreign object found in food, expected to continue eating after it was removed -Disgraceful!","My daughter was eating her spaghetti bolognese when she found what appeared to be a sticker within the sauce. We showed this to who we think is the manager, and he said “oh that’s not good”, and took the sticker away. Leaving the plate of food. When we showed him we asked for a new dinner for my daughter. After some time we asked where the food was, and he hadn’t ordered a new meal, he genuinely expected my daughter to continue eating after finding a sticker in her food. I also asked if the chef had thrown that batch away, and he said yes, when I said I didn’t believe him, he said he had to go and check, meaning he lied to me, and other customers could have received the same batch the sticker was in. She eventually got a new meal, and he waived our bill, however I would have rather paid and had the situation dealt with professionally and hygienically. I am making you aware of this, as I think Prezzo head office should be aware of the poor food preparation, and the absolutely disgraceful way it was dealt with.","Aug 21, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

I didn't want to ask as to not ruin the mood with my girlfriend but was alittle annoyed. Other than this, the food and service was amazing, as usual.

When I asked about it the waiter said he had never heard of the promotion and just walked off saying he could not take my word for it! So, I then showed him my booking confirmation email on my email and the Prezzo promotion advert from Instagram and he still said he could not do anything without ""a code"".  Honestly, it was so embarrassing in front of my whole family. So, no glass of prosecco for us. I was even beginning to doubt myself and then on the way out we saw a big pile of leaflets in the restaurant foyer offering the very same promotion! I am so annoyed about this. This visit was supposed to be special for me and my family and the incompetence of their staff spoiled it for me.  On a positive side the service was fairly quick and all the food was good.  I wrote to their head office about this incident and they acted very quickly and sent me a nice apology letter and a voucher for free prosecco which we will use during our next visit.","Updated Dec 19, 2022",

134,Prezzo,Poor customer service spoiled a pleasant evening birthday meal with old friends,"I frequently visit Prezzo restaurants and have been to the Prezzo in Spalding, Lincolnshire several times and have always been more than happy with the food and service. Not so this evening. I had pre-ordered for a table of 11, the wait for the food was ridiculously long but the worst element of the evening was the incredibly poor customer service. The young woman behind the bar near our table never cracked a smile, let alone even attempt a civil word, and was clearly chewing gum. Her whole demeanour was sullen and unapproachable and we felt we were being a nuisance by politely querying how long we were waiting for our food. I have never felt so irritated or uncomfortable in any restaurant I have visited and, if it weren’t for the company I was in, this would not have been a pleasant evening. The food was relatively good, although two of the orders were cold and had to be sent back. A couple of the staff were pleasant but, again, no apology was offered for the delay and, as mentioned above, we had all pre-ordered and the restaurant was not full. We all agreed that we would not be visiting the Spalding branch again.","Nov 25, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

By 7pm we still didn't have our dinner. I asked politely what time our food was going to arrive. By 7.10pm I still didn't have an answer so left to grab some food from McDonald's before the show. It turned out to be a rush and we tried not to let it spoil the evening. The staff were non-stop and doing their best but it's not OK for them to be so stretched and being criticised.

After a lovely starter we were looking forward to our next course. As the time went on no main course appeared. Even the people at the tables around us had noticed. We mentioned to a couple of the waiters as they passed that we were still waiting for our food and they both said ‘It won’t be long’ Eventually, after around 40 minutes my husband left the table and again asked a waiter what was happening. This particular waiter then went to the manager who went up to the cooking area and within a minute or two brought our main courses. After our long wait I have to say the food was delicious. As we were about to pay the bill the manager explained that the delay was as a result of the restaurant being so busy, which it was and also the fact that there were some trainee waiters who had just arrived that day. I was pleasantly surprised when she said that our main courses were not to be included on our bill. Thank you Prezzo! We appreciated the gesture!

Unfortunately after drinking them, my friend noticed lipstick on her glass.  She doesn't wear make up!  Not great in the middle of a pandemic!   They did give her a complimentary drink though.However, when the deserts came - which we'd ordered as vegan and double-checked they were vegan, we suspected it was dairy cream they came with.  The server assured us it wasn't dairy.  We pointed out that it was dangerous to say it wasn't dairy if it was, and I explained how I'd been ill recently at a wedding when given what I was told was vegan custard, when it was dairy.  He then said he knew the danger as he had a dairy allergy.   Still not convinced we called over the manager, to be told that they don't do vegan cream and that when ordering the vegan dessert as a vegan option, it should come with a different side thing.   Cream is given when its ordered as an 'ordinary' dessert.This is so dangerous!

He then took action and removed it, checked if they were okay (completely ignoring me and then walked away!). I raised his behaviour to Melissa and enquired whether this was a race issue as he checked in on the white couple and removed it on their request despite myself being injured. She said she would look into this, she replied his response was “well I removed it!” . I then spoke to him after submitting my bill stating that I was so surprised that as a manger he showed such lack in compassion for his customers and if this was a race issue, unbelievably he proceeded to lie!!! He stated he checked in on myself and asked the customers on the other table to move—-this never happened. The couple behind us had left but I asked him if he was calling my husband and I liars.

There was also no flavour to the lasagna at all no taste of tomato, it’s flavour was more like a cottage pie between pasta sheets. We’d also asked for two portions of fries and only one came so had to remind regarding the second one which was quickly cooked and put in a bowl and as they were forgotten and rushed through the kitchen they were swimming in grease. I didn’t mention at the time as I was angry that cash would not be accepted and as I was angry and wound up before we even ordered I was concerned I would of come across very rude which I didn’t want to happen.

Never again, Prezzo have lost 2 regular customers for good.","Apr 27, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

175,Prezzo,Prezzo Whiteley Fareham,"Our recent meal this week was nothing short of horrendous. We usually eat at Prezzo and usually have no complaints whatsoever.....1.Our two garlic breads to share were crisp thin, with almost no garlic butter on them.Our three main courses were abysmal.... 2.Sea Bass was overcooked and dry with almost no pesto dressing.  3.Margaretta Pizza was so soggy it was difficult to eat and utterly tasteless.4.One small Pizza & salad had a huge crust with extraordinarily little in the middle, almost no tomato dressing and only the cheese that I ordered as an extra. Because of the large crust with nothing on it, I had no more than 6 mouthfuls, if that.  The side salad dressing was congealed in a lump instead of fluid and did not look remotely inviting!5.We ordered 2 sticky toffee puddings that were so disgusting we sent them back after one mouthful. Usual this our favourite dessert. It fell apart like the inside of an unset jelly. 6. The staff were very helpful and gave us a small discount on our food and did not charge for the two deserts that we returned, but we still spent £60 that was a total waste of money.7. I have never been so disappointed with a meal in its totality, ever.  One or even two things can go wrong but the whole meal was a disaster. It was all food that we had previously ordered & eaten with complete satisfaction on other occasions - in fact a week ago in Eastleigh twice after the cinema.8.Prezzo have told me that they will implement a training programme for their staff, but that has not given me the confidence to go back and spend another £60 to confirm it has worked!!  Prezzo was one of my favourite restaurants - shame! I still can't believe how all three courses could have been so awful for all three of us!!!! In hindsight we should not have paid the bill but instead I did a Google review! which prompted Prezzo to contact me but no mention of a refund or voucher to try them again!","Jul 22, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

177,Prezzo,Prezzo King’s Cross station.,"Prezzo - King’s Cross station. I had the great misfortune to order a chicken Caesar salad at this venue on the 17th of July. My mate ordered a chicken salad with bacon. I got two tiny pieces of chicken breast that were so hard I couldn’t cut them. I picked one piece up to eat it and I left one of the pieces. The poached egg was so small that it would literally sit on a 50 pence piece with room to spare. The bread pieces were rock hard. The salad was entirely lettuce and cucumber. I hate cucumber. However, I ordered the salad because I thought there wouldn’t be much cucumber. There was loads of it and loads of lettuce too. Clearly, the dish was bulked out with cheap salad ingredients. The only enjoyable thing was the vinaigrette/sauce. My mate’s chicken was cut into small pieces and was also rock hard. He got 2 of the tiniest pieces of bacon I have seen. Each piece was about 1 1/2 inches long. Each dish was almost £15. And they levied a service charge which I didn’t realise until I had paid. All in all disgusting! I think organisations that provide such poor service and poor quality food should be forced to refund the cost. In Spain, restaurants have a book in which guests can write poor feedback. We should have the same here in Britain. I feel completely ripped off. I can still hardly believe that Prezzo can get away with providing such poor quality.  I wish I had bought a ready meal salad and a pack of sliced chicken breast from Sainsbury. That would have been a fraction of the price and more enjoyable.","Jul 25, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

182,Prezzo,Prezzo Port Solent,"Prezzo Port Solent - Myself and a friend went into Prezzo in Port Solent yesterday which was not busy. We were seated immediately but it took ages before we were asked whether we would like drinks. It then took about 15 minutes for those to arrive and then the member of staff took our food order. It actually took 40 minutes for our starters to arrive which were a bruschetta and hummus. No cooking involved. We complained when a couple that had arrived about half an hour after us, received their starters. Ours then arrived. Not so long for the mains to arrive but I think that they had been standing around for a while although tasted ok. We then ordered coffees which took 25 minutes after prompting twice as to where they were. 25 minutes for coffee is ridiculous. I felt sorry for the girl serving us as she seemed to be running about all over the place but not sure who was preparing the food. The waitress kept giving some feeble excuses i.e. "" There was a problem at the bar "". We only wanted coffees. I went to the bar to pay as I was not going to wait another half an hour to get the bill. I spoke to the manager and she gave us 30% off the bill but gave me the wrong bill which was more expensive. I pointed this out and she then gave me the correct bill. We were not the only ones complaining, there was a table of quite a lot of people who were not happy. The staff were polite but no-one seems to be able to give a reasonable or if any excuse. They either need to employ more staff or sort out who is cooking the food and to do it in the order of people arriving. Not impressed at all and will not return there. I haven't been in for a couple of years, when with a group of 8 when the waiter forgot to order my meal. By the time my meal came, everyone else had finished. I thought at the time that everyone makes mistakes and would try again but never again.","Jan 3, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
