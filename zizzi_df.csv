0,Zizzi have obviously taken the decision…,"Zizzi have obviously taken the decision to increase their prices and reduce their quality in return. Tonight we had Chicken milanaese which has changed to cheaper processed chicken, smaller cheaper fried potatoes and they have decided to take all sauce away so very dry. The Salmon risotto was an extremely small portion that should not be allowed to be called Salmon. If the was 0.1% Salmon in this under cooked, pre packaged dish I would be very surprised. The vegetable lasagne was the worst of them all. Once again very small portions that is they are selling as 6 layer vegetable lasagne with a list of delicious vegetables. In reality there are 6 layers of pasta with a tomato sauce with potentially some vegetable mixed in with blender. A 1 course meal with a tip for 4 of us with water was £80 for absolute trash processed, pre bagged food. First thing we did when we got home was to make some more food as still hungry, and we are not big eaters Would have been much nicer and much much cheaper and fulfilling to pop into supermarket and get some ready made meals. Did visit about once per month but will not be visiting again.",7 days ago,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
1,Dont use the app and you cant use the toilets!!,"visited Zizi Guilford as a pre-booked party of 12. we allowed 90mins to have our meal before going to a live show at the theatre opposite.the restaurant was not busy when we arrived with only 1 other table occupied.We were asked to use the app to place our orders and that's what caused the problem and spoilt our experience.the qr codes on the table were scanning as invalid so we were given 1 to use for the whole group.12 people trying to order made the app crash.we asked repeatedly if we could place our order with a waiter.no!we then tried with less people ordering but then orders that weren't received originally suddenly pinged through meaning we had multiples.eg: 1 cocktail ordered but 4 arrived, main dishes not arriving  arriving etc.it was a shambles.the waiter did his best to sort things out but we were made to feel it was our fault. we had planned to have a 3course meal but instead had to opt to just have mains as we were on a time limit.when it came to the bill we had to persuade them what we had ordered and rather than apologise again we were made to feel we were purposely trying to get out of paying for food we hadnt had. they tried to say we were under paying when in fact we had made a decision that we were not going to pay the service charge automatically added on per person nor were we going to pay the additional charge for using the app.they weren't happy with this at all and still made no apology for keeping us waiting for our food because of the order mess up.what food we did have we had to rush to eat but was nice and hot. to top of the evening the toilets had NO WATER - a major H&S issue for which they could be closed down.when this was reported again no apology it was brushed off as 'not a problem, we know'.as i said to the staff it is a problem if i cant wash my hands are your staff washing their hands? i will be contacting Zizi customer services and wont be returning.",3 days ago,Rated 2 out of 5 stars

3,Rude staff member,"Me and my elder parents came into Zizi we waited politely too be seated and we questioned when she would get us seated as we waited for at least 5 minutes with no Queue when she was cleaning table after table. She then shouted at us “wait now you’ve only waited 5minutes, I’ll come over in a second” I was incredibly shocked at her tone and the fact she had cleaned at least 5 tables whilst we were waiting, she then continued too clean another table after saying that she would come over, then told me there wasn't at-least 15 items as the fryer was off, we were then waiting too decide if we wanted too say and she snapped “are you coming or going” then sighed and dumped us at a random seat that was seated for 2 (but there was 3 of us), the food was cold and expensive with a long wait time. Honestly I was in shock I have anxiety and this heightened it massively then I was very anxious the whole day the reason I don’t leave the house is because of people like this.",3 days ago,

5,Average at best,Two words great describe this place distinctly average. The meals were luke warm. Overpriced and it took 5 mins sis at the entrance until someone noticed we were there. This was my daughter's choice for her birthday but I will not be going again.,"Oct 16, 2023",
6,Quicker to order through Uber eats!!!,"If felt that Zizzi would rather look after their Uber Eats, Just Eat customer rather the ones who made the effort to go the restaurant!! 40 mins to wait for the starters & the kitchen dealing with the take away orders rather the customers in the restaurant. I could of ordered through my app & got it quicker than in the restaurant....Rude delivery drivers queuing in the restaurant, I felt we were in MacDonalds with everyone hanging around waiting for their order numbers. Wasn't relaxing with guys in helmets hanging around you & barging passed your table. The food when we did get it was substandard & not that nice. Really expensive for what you get & the staff were busy making delivery boxes than looking after the customers in the restaurant. Didnt get asked if everything was okay, just left & we had to call over the staff to order. Wont be going to Zizzi's Hampton Court again I'm afraid","Oct 10, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
7,25% off food bill was reflected in food size/taste!,"On receiving a 25% offer off food we had to show this offer before ordering. My husband ordered the 6 layer lasagne and was given a small portion, my order for the rolled belly pork had fries when it should have been potatoes, on checking I was told it was now always with fries so I suggested they should change their menu! The rainbow carrots served with it was beyond description and not very nice at all. Won’t be back there in a hurry!","Sep 27, 2023",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

9,Gluten free,"This is the 2nd time I've ordered delivery via Uber eats. I can't have gluten and first order was a gluten free pizza wasn't great but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and Tonight ordered plain margherita and a new beef ragu pasta dish which I shared with a friend.I know gluten free pasta and pizza isn't great but for £29 I would have thought in this day and age pizza base would be a bit better. Pizza resembled a pretty soggy cheese on very thin toast and the pasta, it's wasn't great. Pre my gluten free days I remember getting beef ragu from Tesco and it tasted better than this. Gluten free or not gluten free for the price it should taste a lot better.","Sep 28, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

11,We visited Zizzi Loughton on 2nd…,"We visited Zizzi Loughton on 2nd August. On the 23rd August we received a PCN from Gemini parking solutions. They claimed we had parked without authorisation in their car park. We had not been told by the restaurant staff to register our car number.We decided to appeal, we sent an appeal letter; the Royal Mail have confirmed delivery together with a signature. We received no response from our appeal letter despite trying to phone Gemini but never got to speak to human. We received a letter from a debt collection agency instead. We have even emailed Zizzis head office we got no response. I feel as if we have been scammed by Gemini and may be Zizzis too. We will not be ever visiting a Zizzis ever again if this matter remains unresolved!","Sep 22, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Having written in and complained I was even more disgusted at the dismissive response from the branch manager with a discount voucher off food.

17,Zizzi’s Westfield London was horrible,"Zizzi’s Westfield London was horrid. Went for my boyfriends birthday lunch just the two of us, came to £70 for one drink each, a starter to share and a main each!! Absolutely outrageous money for such little reward! The loaded fries were soggy and burnt at the same time (how’s this possible??) the garlic bread we got was cold and wasn’t what it said on the menu as it had 2 ingredients which weren’t listed and none of the ones that were! The carbonara was watery and had no flavour whatsoever, the rustica pizza was the only redeeming thing but even then it was so pricy at £16! Drinks were okay apart from my boyfriend’s cocktail had a fly in it the first time and the second one was watery and had no taste. Staff were nonchalant with us and seemed to be just getting through their shift. Would not recommend!!!","Sep 17, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

19,Zizzi gets a thumbs up from us,"Been a while since dining at Zizzi, visited the Inverness one on Bridge Street yesterday. Had a lovely time, very good service, almost unbelieable quickness after ordering. Couple from Holland sat down next to us, enquired what I was eating as it looked so good, ""Rustica Chicken & Fiery Roquito"" he went on to order it too. My wife had the ""NEW ⭐ Truffle & Pancetta Carbonara"" she was actually pleased with it being a smaller portion than usual, (being 5ft 0"" and a small eater) but made up for it in taste. Loved it, restaurant has been refurbed since last visit & we will be back. Price is ok, compared with say Dominos its a steal to be served rather than takeaway, would love to see a deal for locals, as we are busy with tourists in the summer months.","May 26, 2023",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

The place was rammed, so we worried we might have to wait quite a while, but we were delighted to be served quickly and efficiently.   The staff in there always work so hard, and they seem to be the same faces every time, so they clearly enjoy working there and know how to deliver great service. I like the Zizzi food everywhere, but the Meadow Hall restaurant really do deliver Zizzi at its very best - both in terms of fabulous food quality and tremendous service.

28,Disappointing meal at High Wycombe…,Disappointing meal at High Wycombe branch. Paid £66 for a meal which included bruschetta - their idea of bruschetta consisted of two slices of toast with 6 tomatoes cut in half by the side and a teaspoon of pesto - THIS IS NOT bruschetta! I would also advise against ordering the sharing platters - not worth the £16. The staff inturrupted our starters to tell us the mains were ready and asked if we'd finished our starters when it was clear we were still eating. We felt our meal was rushed and uncomfortable. My wife asked for a box for her remaining pizza and the waitress threw the empty box on the table for my wife to pack up her remaining pizza. Not what I would expect of serving staff. Obviously little or no training given to their staff. Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!I didn't complain to the manager as I thought it would be pointless and just wanted to leave as soon as possible.Needless to say we willl not be visiting this restaurant again.,"Aug 26, 2023",

The food was reasonable, but I was disappointed that the prawn starter now came with a dip, and not the smokey tangy sauce that it had previously been served with. The serving staff were all very good. When it came to paying the bill I tried to pay part of the bill with a gift card. All four serving staff tried numerous times to access it, but with no good result, I eventually paid the bill in full by credit card. Between subtle differences in the food presentation and paying the bill I found the experience disappointing. The next evening the card was taken, on the first occasion it was presented, as part payment of a meal at a local Nando's restaurant. If this is a ploy by Zizzi to get immediate full payment from customers they have now lost a very regular customer.","Jul 30, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

There appeared to be no facilities for anyone with mobility issues: gents toilets ground floor, ladies' upstairs. The ladies only had 2 cubicles, with one of those out of order. The area was tiny, cramped and looked like someone had thrown paint at the walls - it was all very carelessly done. Even the basin had paint over it!

Two of the mains (belly pork) was so coated in oil you could see the puddle when the plate was moved, we asked for new mains and these did arrive quickly but the point of enjoyment for food was out the window by then. The belly pork main also came with limp looking chips rather than crispy small potatoes. It was clearly a bad day in the kitchen for the chefs. One of the desserts (sticky toffee pudding cheesecake) was without the toffee sauce as described leading it to be dry. Service for drinks was slow too, and we had to ask for drinks on numerous occasions before they arrived. Overall, I wouldn't go there again, and wouldn't recommend.

The first two choices were enjoyed, however the second two were very disappointing.The meatballs were almost purified and the rich sauce non existent, liberally sprinkled with dry tasteless breadcrumbs. Two mouthfuls, the rest was not consumed. The risotto was the worst I had ever consumed and did not appear or taste as good as the menu described. It was watery, it lacked flavour and the leeks were tough.On receiving the check, the server was very understanding and reimbursed us for one dish, though I think it should have been for the two so called hot dishes.Considering the tables covered at that time of day, about 5, with no pressure on the staff, you would think the quality of all the food would have been at least 99%.I doubt, by the reviews I have read and my experience, that I will attend Zizzi again.Thank you.","Feb 21, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

137,"Zizzi — Silverburn, Glasgow","My sister and I hosted family (father and younger brother) from overseas and wanted to eat at an Italian restaurant. While I suggested Tony Macaroni, my sister suggested Zizzi's because we were shopping at Silverburn. Around 20:00 while still at Flannels, my sister called Zizzi's to book a table for 4 and they offered us a slot at 21:00. We arrived on time and there were only two other tables so we were seated and offered menus. The issues began after we placed our orders. A few minutes after taking our orders, our waitress (name on the receipt states Keira) came back and said that ""actually, we close at 22:00 today."" I asked what she meant by that as it sounded as if they weren't going to proceed with our order when they themselves gave us the table for four at 21:00 when we called ahead. The young waitress was clearly nervous, unsure of herself and stammered that she wasn't sure what to say but had to let us know then she walked away. We gathered that she had been instructed by the shift supervisor to let us know of the closing time and was nervous about the prospect (presumably to galvanize us into eating quickly). Starters were brought to our table and it was immediately obvious that the waitress was serving at breakneck speed as she placed the plates on the table hastily as we scrambled to make space for her before the plate was placed on top of our phones. As we ate our starters she would come back frequently to ask if we were done. In fact, at one point, when my sister — who wasn't done and still had half her starter on her plate — leaned back in her seat for a small break, the waitress said ""finished, yeah..."" and went to grab the plate before my sister stuck an arm out to stop her and inform her that she wasn't done.Mains were more of the same affair: brought to the table and placed hastily down, parmesan sprinkled quickly and she was gone (had to ask for more cheese for my 8-year-old brother). Even before we were done eating my dad suggested we asked for the bill to keep the peace, so we did that and paid before finishing to eat. Once done we immediately left before we were harassed further. I'm sorry to report that for their first time in Scotland it was not a great dining experience and we will certainly not be returning. We're not ones not to leave a tip but it was so hard to find any good points worth tipping on this occasion so we paid the £93.45 on our bill and left. In hindsight, we should have left the moment we were made aware of the closing time as it was a harbinger of bad service to come. I even suggested as much to my family out of fear the food would be undercooked in a rush to get us out the door. Alas, we stayed when we could've spent the near-£100 at a place where the food was worth that price tag for 3 adults and an 8-year-old. Happy for management to confirm my story via CCTV footage from 21 July 2023 between 21:00 and payment timestamp on the receipt of 21:56.","Sep 18, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

The restaurant was fairly full the empty tables were covered in used crockery and empty glasses which were not cleared away for sometime. The waiter was quite abrupt and wanted to take our food order but we asked for drinks first. We waited for quite some time when he came over again, asking to take the food order not at all happy when we said we were still waiting for our drinks which had been sitting on the bar for quite sometime. There seemed to be an ongoing issue between the two male staff members. After placing out order the starters came fairly quickly but were not up to usual standard.  Before the starter plates were cleared away the main courses arrived and plates had to be shuffled around. The atmosphere continued between the two waiters and no offer to clear the table of main course plates. We began to feel the restaurant getting colder it was now about 9.30pm no one came back to us for pudding order or coffee. The next time we saw somebody they were wanting us to pay the bill.

But moreover, the taste was amazing.We'd all ordered some Rustica pizza's and even though we were almost full up from the starters, we persevered and finished the whole lot! They were so delicious that we just couldn't stop, so, no doggy bags were needed!Throughout our dining experience that night, we were looked after by Grant, Kyra, Palma, Reece and Amy, all of whom were absolutely brilliant.All my friends were so impressed that they want to return, both with their families and with all the rest of the lads that attended the 'lads curry night out'.We have now decided to make this the new 'lads Zizzi night out', so we'll be going to the Bedford Zizzi from now on!Well done Grant and the rest of all those that I've mentioned in this review.Great food, great atmosphere and great service.Well done guys, and keep up the great service.Vince","Aug 13, 2022",

162,"Sutton branch: Rude staff, rude manager and completely clueless.","I visited the Sutton branch with my autistic son, asked for the kids’ menu to have a mini garlic bread instead of the pizza that was on the menu, but Rumali (name listed on the receipt) told me that this was not an option. I asked repeatedly and explained that I was really surprised, because I have visited other r branches before where staff have been only too happy to accommodate this request. For a start, to make a mini garlic bread is not a huge diversion from the menu and secondly, surely, it’s cheaper for them to do this in lieu of an actual mini pizza? I spoke to the manager afterwards, an Eastern European lady who also stated that this was not an option. Again, I explained how shocked I was to hear this, given that other branches have always been only too happy to accommodate this simple request, but she was rather rude. At first, it seemed that she thought I was asking for a full sized garlic bread in place of the mini pizza, but eventually she appeared to understand my request and stated “I’ve never been asked for that in 4 years!” Pizza Express is only across the road from Zizzi in Sutton, so I shall be taking my custom there, the next time I’m in the area. Whilst I’m sure some of this may be down to a language barrier with waiting staff, the menu did actually clearly state “if you need to tweak a dish for your bambini, just ask us.” I pointed this out to the manager, only to be met with disdain.

165,ZIZI at Fosse Park…Best avoided very poor.,"We first visited ZIZI at Fosse Park some time ago. Before we got very far the waitress listed all the items they did not have. They had pizza. The second time we ordered Calzone. The bottom of both was burned and inedible. We returned today hoping for third time lucky. Well my Beef Ragu was ok. I asked for pepper and Parmesan. The waitress returned with Parmesan but not with any pepper. My wife had Meatballs Casareccia. The pasta was over cooked and slimy. The meatballs tasteless, certainly no chilli. The whole thing was covered in breadcrumbs to the point that all the sauce was absorbed. No one asked us if our meals were satisfactory. When we went to pay my wife tried to explain why she had been unable to eat her food. We asked for someone senior to attend us. Instead another waitress arrived with the bill which she had discounted by £3.15. I paid and asked for a receipt. She refused to give me a receipt and walked off. It was quite obvious that no one cared whether the food was up to standard or not. A very poor experience and we shall not be returning.","Mar 9, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Whilst sat there the staff kept kicking one of our party's chairs everytime they went past our table. We asked to be moved as there was lots of couples placed on tables fit for 4 people, additionally there was 3 other table free that we would of have been happy with but in one of the rude members of staff said we can't be moved as other people have booked ps nobody else turned up in the time we was there. We was also told that there's nothing that can be done about our chair constantly being kick. I complained to staff and she was adamant we wasn't moving tables. We told the waitress we would leave our chairs out from the table as to block anyone kicking the chair as they pass. All of a sudden due to fire and h&s we got moved. The staff are Rude and when I complained I was told to leave she even swore at me.There is very Bad or no management Out of the 4 people we dealt they all had Bad social skills.

She kind of ranted to us then said she was sorting the problem out and that she was the supervisor. Said the mozzarella salad was now off the menu and took the plate of tomatoes away that we was told to keep free of charge .My sister and I looked at each other in shock and puzzled .Then the waiter who was originally dealing with us came over with a plate of tomatoes and a quarter of mozzarella cheese sitting in the middle in which we told him to take back as this was certainly not the meal explained on the menu .I in the mean time order a latte with was full of coffee grounds asked them to take back .A man then came over to us and apologised and said we could have 20% off our bill which was very nice of him ..we are very disgusted by how rude the supervisor was to us and got the bill and left.

173,One New Change needs a BIG change!,"My friend and I visited the Zizzi in One New Change, London. It was appalling. There were only about three other customers int he restaurant but the place was littered with dirty tables full of debris from other customers - left over food, dirty plates, glasses and cutlery. Despite there being three waitresses in the place they ambled around NOT clearing the tables, instead one was even texting on her 'phone. We watched as they walked past the dirty tables over and over again without even picking up a plate to take to the kitchen! It wouldn't have taken ten minutes to clear them and reset them - it's not even like the place was busy! It took at least 15 minutes for a waitress to come back and take our order and then we waited another 15 minutes for our food - with three customers in the place????By the time the food came out we still hadn't received our soft drinks either which is really not good enough.On seeing my friend's food I knew immediately that it was over cooked and she took one mouthful and knew the fish was off. My food was instead undercooked and the outside of the dish filthy dirty so when I took it off the waitress my hands got covered in the food that should have been INSIDE the dish. The waitress said that she would swap the fish but we decided that we did not want to eat in a restaurant with such blatant disregard  for either appearances, hygiene or indeed it's customers. We will not be back and indeed doubt we will want to visit a Zizzi restaurant again.","Sep 2, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

175,Terrible Service & Constant Waiting!!,"Zizzi Manchester Corn ExchangeService: dreadful. Either waiting too long from wanting to place our order to dessert menu. I had to ask for everything. My granddaughter had a set meal and I had to ask for her drink and dessert. Staff spent more time talking to each other, and seemed to have little interest in customer service. The girl serving us seemed new, lacked confidence or common sense. Placed drinks order which took ages, then there was a drink missing.Food: Starter garlic bread with mozzarella & onions, cheese barely there and lots of onion. Kids starter fine. Main: my son and grandson ordered spaghetti carbonara with pancetta and chorizo. Arrived with huge slice of bacon on top and no chorizo in sight. Ravioli few pieces slightly burnt, very overcooked and tasteless. Child’s pizza was ok. Dessert: we were asked if we wanted the bill without ever being asked if we wanted the dessert menu. I had to ask for the child’s fruit bowl. Drinks: after first order where I had to ask for the missing drink, no further visit to the table to ask if we wanted more drinks. I had to ask for the chococino that came with the child’s meal.Facilities: staff using baby changing toilet meant my son had to wait 15 minutes before he could change my granddaughter.Seating: there was a huge area not being used other than by staff. We were seated at a table with 4 uncomfortable chairs next to the kitchen yet there was better seating available. People walking in were being turned away even though there were empty tables.My first ever visit to Zizzi and I can honestly say I won’t ever visit a Zizzi again!!!","Nov 13, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

179,Zizzi Telford,"Went to Zizzi Telford as a family now in the current climate going out is a treat and out of all the restaurants that we could have chosen we decided to go here.So we walked in and stood by the door and waited as the sign says wait to be seated, eventually a woman says that she will e a few minutes and we continued to wait, a few minutes later we were seated with our menus.I had a discount code for one starter and ordered a couple of starters to share, drinks and the mains. I also showed the waitress the zillionaires member code as it says too (first time I used it) the waitress went off and then came back and said that I could not have the free starter, no explanation I just could not have it, she said do you want to speak to the manager I said yes.The manager comes over I explain I have a code she takes it and I said that the waitress said I cant have it, no explanation, so off she goes and then comes back and says that the code is not able to be used on a Friday and did I still want the starter I said yes and thanks for letting me know that it could not be used, and tells the waitress that I want the order still.The waitress comes over 5 minutes later and asks again do I still want the starter again yes I still want the starter.The starters arrived after 45minutes, now the restaurant was not busy, and once the starter was finished the mains took ages to arrive also.The food is ok and I like the flavours but the portion size has been reduced and I would not normally be hungry still after going out for a meal, and especially after eating fresh pasta which is filling, but on this occasion I was.The manager came over and I asked for the bill she walked off, I thought to go get the bill as she was by what looked like a till, then she disappeared and we could not see her, then we noticed her doing stuff behind the bar I think she was sorting glasses or stocking the fridge.So, we went to the front counter and eventually she came over and I paid, also it turns out that with the use of the zillionaires club I should have been entitled to a free garlic bread, but I have lost out on that now because should have been given to me on my visit.Overall not the best and I will think long and hard before returning, if I ever do. If I return I will post a new review.","Mar 2, 2023",Rated 3 out of 5 stars
180,Appalling experience,"Today a friend and I visited the One New Change  (St Paul’s) branch of Zizzi. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. On entry to the restaurant we saw 2 4 seater tables uncleared from previous meals. They were still uncleared when we left. There were a further 3 tables covered in debris. The restaurant was not busy, only a couple of tables were occupied. We were shown to a table and given menus. Eventually we ordered a main meal each and drinks. During our wait, little attempt was made to clear any of the tables. One of the waitresses made a half hearted attempt to clean some tables and the other waitress commented that she was happy to wipe tables but didn’t want to clear any. One of the waitress was texting on her phone or gossiping to her colleague. Goodness only knows how they’d cope if the restaurant was busy. After a wait,  the food arrived without the drinks. My salmon was over cooked and tasted bad, I believed it to be off. The potatoes were horrible. My friend’s risotto contained undercooked leeks, was a rather small portion and the plate had food smeared under the rim. We complained and the waitresses attempted to deal with it but by this time, the general apathetic attitude of the staff combined with a lack of attention to the customers  and surroundings, left us with no alternative but to leave. Frankly, I didn’t trust the staff to provide us with an edible meal after what we had experienced. This is the first time I have ever left a restaurant without paying. Nothing would have induced me to pay for such incompetence. I have eaten in my local branch of Zizzi and had enjoyable meals. I can only conclude that the staff haven’t been trained properly and the future looks bleak for this branch of Zizzi.","Sep 1, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
181,Awful meal.  Waste of money,"My wife and I went to Zizi Wokingham tonight.  My wife  ordered the pork meatballs with pasta.  She struggled through the meal.  No mention on the menu that it had hot spices in it.  It was so hot that she could only eat some of it.  I tried it and it was so spicy that i couldn't eat more than one piece of pasta.  We told the waitress, who by the way was very nice.  We said she should tell the cook that the meal was inedible.  She came back and merely said it had chilli flakes in the sauce. It was so over spiced and meant that my wife didn't have a meal.  So very disappointing and ruined our night out.","Aug 18, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

184,Arrived 7.35 and didn't get our food,"Hampton Court - Arrived 7.35 and didn't get our food until gone 9pm.  No offer of another round of drinks until we asked.  Excuses of ""we're very busy"" and ""everyone's having to wait"" doesn't help when you're rather hungry on the verge of hangry.  You know when you're going out for a nice family meal and you don't have much lunch to ""save yourself"", well that was us.  The standard response to our enquiry on time was 2 minutes, in Zizzi speak this is 20 minutes.  When it finally did come, my husband's meal was completely forgotten (and came in another ""2 minutes""!), my daughter's side was forgotten - you guessed it, and when it did turn up, the ""large"" fries was no more than a small handful.  My dish arrived with zucchini and it clearly stated cauliflower on the menu.  I cannot stand zucchini and would have no way ordered it.  When questioned, the first waitress disappeared and never came back and it took me an absolute age to catch someone's eye to discuss it.  The new waitress (maybe the manager) picked up the menu and started to study it as if I were lying.  Firstly, don't they know their own menu and secondly, why do that to an already tetchy customer?  I was later told the ingredient list in the kitchen was different, so...?  I was so hungry by that point and everyone else was close to finishing their meals, so I just asked for something quick, like a garlic bread or something.  Yes, you guessed it, another Zizzi 2 minutes - I was ravenous and although family were offering their meals, I chose to wait.  As I got up to tell the waitress to cancel that order as I was simply done, I was told it was literally out of the kitchen - not quite, unless the kitchen is a phenomenally long way from the table.  I sat and nibbled a couple of pieces of shoe leather garlic bread but I was over it by that point.  We were offered a dessert on the house but as my dear old mum said ""we don't want to be here until midnight!"".  They did discount the bill, which saved us an argument but it was such a spoiled event for a family birthday.  Its not even like we were hidden away in a corner, we were right by the door and the pay station - really obvious we were sitting there for almost 2 hours with nothing in front of us.","May 4, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

187,We had a bad experience last night at…,"We had a bad experience last night at the York Zizzis restaurant. Firstly when the waitress came to take our order we asked to see the gluten free menu. We were handed a plastic folder with a list of every item on the menu with allergens listed. Which we found odd as have recently visited Pizza Express and Prezzo where they have a separate menu with all gluten free items on. Then when we tried to order our food, I explained I did not want cheese on my pizza. She asked if it was an allergy and I said yes. The waitress explained that we would have to order through their Speedy app as she could not take the order! We then spent ages trying to use the app and it would not let us remove an item from the pizza, there was only an option to add extras. We asked our waitress who explained she was new and she didn't know how to use the app, she got the manager to come over who also said she didn't know how to use it! So when I said could we just order through her she said yes but she would not be able to order me anything that has cheese on it! So I ended up having something off the menu I didn't really want. She was apologetic and said it was company policy. While we were in the restaurant (there were only 4 other tables of customers) the 3 waitresses turned down 4-5 groups of customers that came in asking for a table, they were asked if they had booked and told no we don't have a table for you if you haven't booked! The restaurant had maybe 10 spare tables it was after 8pm on a Monday evening! So not sure why they did this!

Manager came through and the discussion lasted for a while but we found there wasn't any way to reach the point of understanding - unfortunately even more confusing.We were full of doubts: 1. Waiter kept saying there wasn't any balance left in the gift card          - Did it mean there was £0 balance left in the gift cards? But the bill was just £32.202. Manager telling us they can't give back the balance           - Was she presuming we requesting a new issue of gift card with an updated balance? Of course we not, we do know any gift card balance will be updated automatically and it is unnecessary to issue a new one after each time of consumption3. They insisted not to give back the printout gift cards to us because ""those were in the bin""           - Although the balance can be checked online without having a physical gift card in hand, we don't think it's appropriate to throw away a cash equivalent gift card with unspent value which can be used by anyone          - We can't understand the insistency of refusing to return something belongs to us, even though something might be considered as wasteWe gave up to discuss any more and just asked to get back the threw-away gift cards as well as the receipt of the meal.Later the night, we checked the balance of the gift cards online and found the total value of £35 in the gift cards was used up (That's why the gift cards became waste of the bin) and found the difference of £2.8 was counted as tips which was listed in the bill.It's meaningless to discuss if their service worth this £2.8 tips, it is completely an unauthorised transaction - no one has ever made us aware of this transaction even though there had been a prolonged conversation about the bill and the gift cards.Please Zizzi can you give a response to these?1. Is this a tradition of your restaurant to use up customer's gift card value and count the balance as tips without customers' consent? (Fortunately we haven't bought a £100 worth gift card)2. Is this also a tradition of your restaurant to throw away customers' gift card and refuse to return upon customers' request? (Fortunately we didn't give them the electronic format gift card by an iPhone or I had to pick it up from the bin)","Apr 2, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Whereas i had a voucher for prezzo which they did honour perfectly. Zizzi has acted in a dishonorable way and no reason given. Won't be seeing me again,"Jun 11, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

215,Fab Staff,We came to the Restaurant after having been given a voucher. Staff were so friendly and helpful (especially  Geri) and we really enjoyed our meal.

216,"GREAT STAFF, GREAT FOOD - ZIZZI BRACKNELL","GREAT STAFF, GREAT FOODIve had a lovely SELF TIME meal at ZIZZI BRACKNELL. SARVESH has accommodated me well when i first came in the restaurant. ZIZZI fried calamares are just 10/10 !!! texture, moist, seasoning, it just tastes so good !! This is my main reason i always choose ZIZZI for italian dish at a high street, their calamari and their pizzas are my favourites !! Also, ANNE-MARIA and her other colleague, are just so helpful all the time, as they made sure that ive got everything at the table, and therefore I made this review to highlight their service, very friendly and very accommodating team !! ZIZZI never let me down yet, except for 1 thing... PLEASE KINDLY ADD TABASCO BOTTLE SAUCE, as it actually goes perfect with your PIZZAS =)","Jun 2, 2022",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

219,Noisy atmosphere,"I used to like Zizzi -- the vegan menu, the nice atmosphere and so on.But they've gone downhill lately -- like today (a Sunday), we went into a local branch (Tower Hill) and requested a quiet table. Then, 5 minutes after our food arrived a party of about 15+ people turned up, were placed right next to us and we had to endure a horde of noisy children and over excited parents.That's not the first time we've had to walk out of Zizzi due to the noise -- last time was at St. Katharine Docks, where a team of drunken women were screeching so loudly over their wine that we couldn't hear ourselves speak.Our only option was to get everything in a box so we could leave.The food is OK, but if you like quiet restaurants, this will not be for you.","May 29, 2022",
