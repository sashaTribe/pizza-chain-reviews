3, Pizza Express,Never again - ¬£17 for paper thin tasteless pizza,"The pizzas have become so thin now, it goes cold in 5 minutes. The romana base is now paper thin. When we complained, the manager (who was also our server) was disgusted with us and didn‚Äôt come near us again after that. She did get it heated up though. Also the prices have rocketed while the dough and toppings have decreased. Never again. Outlet centre, Swindon.","Oct 19, 2023",

Ordered pizza I had a thicker one, it was ok, asked if she had any ketchup and mayo, no we don't have any ! My daughter ordered extra olives ¬£1.50 for 7 olives, no chips available, only polenta fries which tasted absolutely awful. Oh and if you have a ¬£1 and ¬£1.50 voucher it doesnt accept them. Wouldn't go again even if it was free which at their proces wouldnt ever happen !. Waste of tesco clubcard vouchers. This was the Peterborough Cathedral Square restaurant.  Oh and as we was leaving at 6.30 the party that had the table reservation was a member of staff eating her food on her own in the booth. You're a joke @pizzaexpress.","Oct 21, 2023",

6, Pizza Express,What a Rip Off,"We are Pizza Express Gold members as we used to go there regularly .That might not be the case in future!!!We always order the same meals in fact dont really need a menu , so we notice change in food prices etc.Normally our meal at a weekend comes to just less than ¬£80 with our discounts for being Gold Members. Tonight it came to ¬£95.35 for the same meal a 20% increase. Spoke to the manageress who was delightful and Ive spoken to her before and she advised prices with the New App had gone up she had been told, But 20% increase when we are all feeling the pressure of increased electricity , mortgage rates to name but a few is totally ridiculous. We are all told to support our local restaurants but how can we when we are being RIPPED OFF. Appreciate Pizza Express costs have gone up but not 20% . No refurb of Restaurant and I‚Äôm sure staff havent had that kind of salary increase. So not surprised Restaurant not full and we will not be going back regularly as truthfully dont think meal is now value for money. Not impressed Pizza Express and I‚Äôm sure pople will make their feelings known and go elsewhere.Shame on you Pizza Express","Oct 15, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

I have asked them if the just eat drivers cook the pizzas and that‚Äôs why they are to blame. No answer back yet.

The pizza was burnt and the waiter who sounded like a weird American or Canadian accent plonked it on our table and said ‚ÄúCrispy‚Äù. What a disgrace we paid for our two beers left and got out of there. Disgusting service Daniel the Chef üò±should have just said sorry it‚Äôs burnt and apologised and we would have understood why we waited so long instead of trying to con us into accepting a cremated pizza. We‚Äôve never been in a Pizza Express before but you‚Äôve certainly left an impression that won‚Äôt be forgotten.

35, Pizza Express,First time takeaway takes ages,"Whatever happened to picking up the phone to order a pizza? You can only use the website. The choices are limited for takeaway. The words ""exclusive delivery"" are used a lot. This means excluded from delivery not exclusive pizza or delivery exclusively. Items are then marked as unavailable when you get to the basket. After you have chosen what you want you have to join Pizza Express, so application form plus password which incidentally wasn't accepted initially. We found it wouldn't allow us to pay either the first time we tried, telling us our passwords were wrong when they weren't. Took half an hour to order in total, so watch out with first time ordering. Food arrived quickly but was on the cool side so, in all, not particularly successful.

How were dishes being washed ?- how were hands being washed? By this time I was asking myself ""is this even legal?"" and left to myself would have left - but - well - teenagers...So without jugged water we requested Fanta - not available, then asked for 1 diet and 1 regular Coke.  We got 2 diet cokes.The food - to be fair my grandson seemed to enjoy his pizza, but my Salade Nicoise was tragic!  To agree with my grandson's opinion - it really did look like the cat had puked on it.  I could not eat it.  The dish was just removed without any comment or question.Then dessert - first choices (2) unavailable because there was no gelato.  By this time all I wanted was a cup of tea - but - no hot drinks available.I asked the waiter why not just close until the problems were sorted - but like so much else the answer was unavailable!The bill came to ¬£55.40 - total waste, not only money but the rare chance of having an enjoyable time with my grandson.  How do they dare offer an experience like this and call it service?I will never return.","Sep 6, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

64, Pizza Express,Overcharging for Romano Duo,"We've not been to PE for some time. I didn't notice a 'problem' with the bill till after we got home:We ordered a 'Romano Duo', half American Hot (with extra Tuna) and half margarita (with extra Olives). We were charged the full price for each of the 'Extras', even though only half the pizza had each extra on it. The 'Romano Duo' is already ¬£1 more than an 'non-Duo' Romano,  so it feels like this is deliberate overcharging. We should have been charged half the price of each of the Extras, plus the ¬£1 ""Duo"" charge. A small, but irritating scam.Disappointed to see ""Veneziana"" no longer available. Many fewer pizza choices, many more non-pizza dishes, meaning PE no longer has a USP and we are less likely to go again. Pricing now similar to many other bistros, who do non-pizza dishes better....","May 8, 2023",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

The food was nice enough but the pizzas we chose had hardly any meat on them, i.e bbq burnt ends only had 4-5 pieces of meat on it and the same with the La Cabana pizza and the pulled pork. The main course was brought out without the staff clearing away the starter dishes and desert was brought out and main course dishes still on the table. We did complain to the manager and did not have an apology only said she would reduce the bill which was not the point and she did not clear the dishes that were all over the table either.definately would not recommend.It was my sons birthday and definately took the edge of this","Jun 26, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

136, Pizza Express,PizzaExpress MK shopping centre.,"We were seated and within a couple of minutes we were served. That‚Äôs when it all went down hill.The restaurant was around half full with plenty of staff, our drinks came in good time but the food took a lifetime to get to us, I can only assume this was down to all the deliveries taking priority over the eat in customers. When we did get our food it wasn‚Äôt very hot and since we haven‚Äôt been to pizza express in quite a longtime I was very disappointed with how small they have gotten, the Leggero that has salad placed in the hole looked very thin compared to the last time we ate there and the hole in the middle where they place the salad was absolutely massive taking away a lot more pizza base than ever before. I would have liked the Calzone myself but the filling either had chillies in it or more chillies in it, so there was no other options and was told they can‚Äôt take out all the chillies.I then looked for a pizza with plenty of veg on it, not that I am a vegitarian, I just enjoy the veg i pizza, I ended up going for the Vegan Giardiniera Romana, it says bigger thinner crispier, it was small definitely very thin and not that crispy, it wasn‚Äôt very appetising at all.  I was also sat facing the kitchen, I like this idea.Not so sure it was a good idea though.One chefs stood there picking a spot on his cheek.There were all the drivers collecting the takeaway food standing to the side of the kitchen and sometimes getting in the way, they were even help box the pizzas up and sometime man handling the food, so much for hygiene. Other chefs were occasionally removing them from the boxes taking them across the other side for some reason then bringing them back to put them in the box, I could see from where I was sitting so I don‚Äôt know why.   We skipped the desert and asked for the bill because we had just had enough of everything that went on, the bill took forever to get to us, so there was no tip and we left still feeling a little peckish and fed up.","Aug 6, 2023",

140, Pizza Express,Rochester pizza express. This was honestly the worst experience‚Ä¶,"Pizza express Rochester. This was honestly the worst experience I have ever had in an hospitality environment. Half way through my meal, I reported an issue with a couple of flies/insects that were constantly buzzing around the table. When I approached the restaurant duty manager about this, she literally laughed and smiled without saying anything. Upon walking back to my table, a member of a table opposite took it upon themselves and said to me ‚Äòit must just be you as there aren‚Äôt any problems here‚Äô and then proceed to say ‚Äòyou just don‚Äôt want to pay‚Äô. I have never been subjected to these sorts  of insulting degrading comments before, and especially not in a hospitality environment as a paying customer. After mentioning this to members of staff, they literally did nothing but say that I was the one who was being unreasonable. Upon mentioning what the manager had previously do to another member of staff, he literally denied that it had happened, whilst also telling me that I should just accept the insects because ‚Äò it‚Äôs just the area that we are in‚Äô. How they could have this approach is truly mind boggling. To  not only be so rude themselves, but to then just let another customer make such derogatory comments is truly staggering. This restaurant needs to be investigated, and the ceo will be contacted in due course.","Mar 24, 2023",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

My first impression was that the restaurant looked tired and a bit grubby. We ordered starters and when they arrived. The calamari was burnt black in places. It was clearly visible but they decided to serve it anyway. The garlic bread was cold and uncooked. We were waiting for it to be replaced when the main course arrived. So we told the waiter that the starters were now not required and to remove them from the bill. I alway have my favourite Fiorentinna pizza but when it arrived the egg was broken in the middle and had run over the pizza. They then cooked it and it was all rubbery. Again they must have known it wasn‚Äôt right but served it anyway. By this time we were short of time to get to our show so I had to eat the dry overcooked pizza.

171, Pizza Express,"Pizza Express St Andrews - Shockingly slow service, too greedy with online orders and bums on seats and taking on too much than they can handle to be able to provide a half decent service.","We took our family of four to the Pizza Express in St Andrews as a special easter treat. Having dined at other Pizza Express establishments in livingston and Edinburgh and being generally happy with the food and service we did not think there would be any issues. We really were appalled and frustrated with the service that we received today - our children did receive the kid's 3 course menu but my husband and I only had a main course - we were in the place for just shy of two hours! We were all starving and had finished our drinks long before the kid's starters even came out. Even tho we were sat right in front of the drinks station not once were we asked if we needed anything. After sitting and starving for 1hr 10 minutes my husband asked whether our food was even ready as we had by now had enough and were ready to just leave and get food elsewhere but were assured that it would only be another 5 minutes. Personally I enjoyed the Nduja calzone but my husband was less than impressed with his pizza and one of the children's pizzas were overdone.We did sit and watch other patrons get served before us inspite of being seated after us and watched in embarrassment and sympathy for the parents at the table next to us as their main courses were brought out to be told that there had been a mix up and that their children's (who must have both been under five) mains had not been cooked and would be with them as soon as possible.One thing which was abundantly clear and even our children picked up on was the priority and importance that Pizza Express put on their deliveroo customers. Anyone wishing to attend the restaurant in person, buy extras, pay service charges are clearly second class citizens compared to their online customers and are most likely, constantly bumped to the back of the queue as soon as an online order comes through. I really wish that we had left and ate elsewhere, we paid just shy of ¬£60 which may not sound like much but in today's financial climate, being able to treat our family is something that we have to consider carefully and do less often and to think that we made a special trip to St Andrews just so that we could eat there... really just spoiled our day I'm afraid.Essentially, this restaurant was more interested in being greedy by getting as much money through deliveroo orders and bums on seats, taking on more than they could handle rather than following up with good service...","Apr 10, 2023",

211, Pizza Express,Pizza Express- Welwyn Garden City‚Ä¶,Pizza Express- Welwyn Garden City Restaurant! Utter filth and the customer service is appalling! I hope this restaurant closes down so a better restaurant can take its place. We have been coming to this place since so many years and ordering food via Just Eat too. The customer service us home down from bad to worse.I spoke to ‚Äòmanager‚Äô about my missing food (all paid more than ¬£70)and he said the delivery driver must have eaten it so call the driver and sort it out myself! If you cannot provide food via Just eat why do you get itself registered to online delivery food apps! Please don‚Äôt cheat your customers!,"Oct 22, 2022",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
212, Pizza Express,NOT GLUTEN FREE - BEWARE COELIACS,"NOT GLUTEN FREE - PIZZA EXPRESS FARNHAM, SURREY - BE AWARE COELIAC'sIF I could rate ZERO I would. We stressed that our daughter was Coeliac and they assured us they do not cross contaminate bla bla. Within an hour of leaving the restaurant our daughter was poorly. Not food poisoning (because I had some of the pizza) but she was served non gluten free food. She was very poorly for a week following this and we even had to take her to the Dr. I have written to the complaints department and supplied a full audit of times, documentation etc and I have emailed over 3 times for a response but nothing apart from a confirmation they have received the complaint. I would suggest that Coeliac UK reconsiders promoting this business as Coealic friendly!!! Because of it's total lack of education on the subject and disregard for making a 10 year old very poorly!! how can a company like this, get away with it! This complaint will get ignored along with the thousands of others because they do not care! I have heard other stories about Coeliac's being poorly after meals at Pizza Express. Strange really since Coeliac Disease was discovered in Italy!!! We complained in 13th August and have had zero response about this case and it's now OCTOBER - Utterly disgraceful. Sicko's.","Oct 17, 2022",

214, Pizza Express,Pizza Express Stockton Heath,Pizza Express Stockton Heath - what has happened?  We use to love this place. Now the quality of the pizzas  is so poor compared to what we have had over the past 20 years.  The Leggara Pizza has now a massive whole taken from the middle rather than a smaller whole that used to be filled with a beautiful salad. Now you just get rocket leaves and a circle of 2 inch wide pizza.  They used to be so accommodating when ordering variations from the menu now there‚Äôs no flexibility at all. The whole experience of eating there has been lost. Sorry Pizza Express you‚Äôre going to lose custom. We won‚Äôt be visiting like we use to.,"Oct 16, 2022",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

They allowed all the children to have a taste of the toppings,so they was able to try different foods.They made it so much fun and made the children laugh and smile the whole way through.
